## Requirements

To successfully run this project, you will need the following:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation

To get started, follow these installation steps:
1. Install Python 3.x from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open the Command Prompt terminal.
3. Type `python --version` to check if Python is already installed and if it is, verify that the version is up-to-date.
4. Verify the preferred installer program, `pip`, by typing `pip --version`.
5. Install Jupyterlab by running `pip install jupyterlab` in the Command Prompt terminal.
6. Install Jupyter Notebook by running `pip install jupyter notebook` in the Command Prompt terminal.
7. Once Jupyter Notebook has finished downloading, you will see the file path location in the terminal. Copy this path file location and paste it on a new line, and then hit enter. In my case, the file path is:<br>
`C:\Users\ayans\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`
8. Install the necessary packages by running `pip install pandas`, `pip install numpy`, `pip install matplotlib`, and `pip install seaborn` in the Command Prompt terminal.
9. Create a folder on your desktop for this project. For example:<br><br> ![Desktop Folder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80643467/230805087-43a0eab9-3563-4e95-a2d2-b49798e6376a.png)<br><br>
10. Once you have created the desktop folder, open the folder and copy the folder path location. In my case, the folder path location is: `C:\Users\ayans\Desktop\Test_Jupyter`
11. Paste the folder path location into the Command Prompt terminal by typing `cd C:\Users\ayans\Desktop\Test_Jupyter`
12. After pasting the folder path location, the path will change to:<br><br> ![JN- STEP 7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80643467/230805177-300bda0a-ef73-40cf-a17c-8167e8204684.png)<br><br>
13. Type `jupyter notebook` and hit enter. You will see a new tab open in your browser displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.
14. Click on the following options to get started, as shown in the image below:<br><br> ![JN- STEP 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80643467/230805220-9d2bea58-36c6-45b7-986f-447243425ab1.png)<br><br>

## Jupyter Notebook - Python Programming

To begin football data analysis with Python, follow these steps:

Step 1:
```python
# Import Librarirs

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```

Step 2:
```python
# Load EPL data into a DataFrame

epl_df = pd.read_csv('C:\\Users\\ayans\\Downloads\\EPL_20_21\\EPL_20_21.csv')
epl_df.head()
```

Step 3:
```python
# Print a summary of the DataFrame

epl_df.info()
```

Step 4:
```python
# Print summary statistics of the DataFrame

epl_df.describe()
```

Step 5:
```python
# Count the number of missing values (NaN) in each column of epl_df

epl_df.isna().sum()
```

Step 6:
```python
# Create 2 new columns

epl_df['MinsPerMatch'] = (epl_df['Mins'] / epl_df['Matches']).astype(int)
epl_df['GoalsPerMatch'] = (epl_df['Goals'] / epl_df['Matches']).astype(float)
epl_df.head()
```

Step 7:
```python
# Total Goals

Total_Goals = epl_df['Goals'].sum()
print(Total_Goals)
```

Step 8:
```python
# Penalty Goals

Total_PenaltyGoals = epl_df['Penalty_Goals'].sum()
print(Total_PenaltyGoals)
```

Step 9:
```python
# Penalty Attempts

Total_PenaltyAttempts = epl_df['Penalty_Attempted'].sum()
print(Total_PenaltyAttempts)
```

Step 10:
```python
# Pie chart for penalties missed vs scored

plt.figure(figsize = (13, 6))
pl_not_scored = epl_df['Penalty_Attempted'].sum() - Total_PenaltyGoals
data = [pl_not_scored, Total_PenaltyGoals]
labels = ['Penalties Missed', 'Penalty Scored']
color_palette = sns.color_palette("Paired")
plt.pie(data, labels = labels, colors = color_palette, autopct = '%.0f%%')
plt.show()
```

Step 11:
```python
# Unique positions

epl_df['Position'].unique()
```

Step 12:
```python
# Total FW Players

epl_df[epl_df['Position'] == 'FW']
```

Step 13:
```python
# Players from different nations

np.size((epl_df['Nationality'].unique()))
```

Step 14:
```python
# Most players from which countries

nationality = epl_df.groupby('Nationality').size().sort_values(ascending = False)
nationality.head(10).plot(kind = 'bar', figsize = (12, 6), color = sns.color_palette('magma'))
```

Step 15:
```python
# Clubs with maximum players in their squad

epl_df['Club'].value_counts().nlargest(5).plot(kind = 'bar', color = sns.color_palette("viridis"))
```

Step 16:
```python
# Clubs with latest players in their squad

epl_df['Club'].value_counts().nsmallest(5).plot(kind = 'bar', color = sns.color_palette("viridis"))
```

Step 17:
```python
# Players based on age group

Under20 = epl_df[epl_df['Age'] <= 20]
age20_25 = epl_df[(epl_df['Age'] > 20) & (epl_df['Age'] <= 25)]
age25_30 = epl_df[(epl_df['Age'] > 25) & (epl_df['Age'] <= 30)]
Above30 = epl_df[epl_df['Age'] > 30]
```

Step 18:
```python
# Assuming the following DataFrame exist: Under20, age20_25, age25_30 and Above30

x = np.array([Under20['Name'].count(),age20_25['Name'].count(),age25_30['Name'].count(),Above30['Name'].count()])
mylabels = ["<=20", ">20 & <=25", ">25 & <=30", ">30"]
plt.title('Total Players with Age Groups', fontsize=20)
plt.pie(x, labels=mylabels, autopct = "%.1f%%")
plt.show()
```

Step 19:
```python
# Total under 20 players in each club

players_under_20 = epl_df[epl_df['Age'] < 20]
players_under_20['Club'].value_counts().plot(kind = 'bar', color = sns.color_palette("cubehelix"))
```

Step 20:
```python
# Under 20 players in Manu

players_under_20[players_under_20["Club"] == 'Manchester United']
```

Step 21:
```python
# Under 20 players in Chelsea

players_under_20[players_under_20["Club"] == 'Chelsea']
```

Step 22:
```python
# Average age of players in each club

plt.figure(figsize = (12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x = 'Club', y = 'Age', data = epl_df)
plt.xticks(rotation = 90)
```

Step 23:
```python
# Group the English Premier League DataFrame (epl_df) by club and count the number of players in each club

num_player = epl_df.groupby('Club').size()
data = (epl_df.groupby('Club')['Age'].sum()) / num_player
data.sort_values(ascending = False)
```

Step 24:
```python
# Total assists from each club

Assits_by_club = pd.DataFrame(epl_df.groupby('Club', as_index = False)['Assists'].sum())
sns.set_theme(style = "whitegrid", color_codes = True)
ax = sns.barplot(x = 'Club', y = 'Assists', data = Assits_by_club.sort_values(by = 'Assists'), palette = 'tab20')
ax.set_xlabel("Club", fontsize = 30)
ax.set_ylabel("Assists", fontsize = 20)
plt.xticks(rotation = 75)
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (20, 8)
plt.title('Plot of Club vs Total Assists', fontsize = 20)
```

Step 25:
```python
# Top 10 Assists

top_10_assists = epl_df[['Name', 'Club', 'Assists', 'Matches']].nlargest(n = 10, columns = 'Assists')
top_10_assists
```

Step 26:
```python
# Creating a DataFrame to group the total goals scored by each club

Goals_by_clubs = pd.DataFrame(epl_df.groupby('Club', as_index = False)['Goals'].sum())
sns.set_theme(style ="whitegrid", color_codes = True)
ax = sns.barplot(x = 'Club', y = 'Goals', data = Goals_by_clubs.sort_values(by ="Goals"), palette = 'rocket')
ax.set_xlabel("Club", fontsize = 30)
ax.set_ylabel("Goals", fontsize = 20)
plt.xticks(rotation =75)
plt.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (20, 8)
plt.title('Plot of Club vs Total Goals', fontsize = 20)
```

Step 27:
```python
# Most goals by players

top_10_goals = epl_df[['Name', 'Club', 'Goals', 'Matches']].nlargest(n = 10, columns = 'Goals')
top_10_goals
```

Step 28:
```python
# Goals per match

top_10_goals_per_match = epl_df[['Name', 'GoalsPerMatch', 'Matches', 'Goals']].nlargest(n = 10, columns = 'GoalsPerMatch')
top_10_goals_per_match
```

Step 29:
```python
# Pie Chart - Goals with assist and without assist

plt.figure(figsize = (14, 7))
assists = epl_df['Assists'].sum()
data = [Total_Goals - assists, assists]
labels = ['Goals without assists', 'Goals with assists']
color = sns.color_palette('Set2')
plt.pie(data, labels = labels, colors = color, autopct ='%.0f%%')
plt.title('Percentage of Goals with Assists', fontsize = 20)
plt.show()
```

Step 30:
```python
# Top 10 players with most yellow cards

epl_yellow = epl_df.sort_values(by = 'Yellow_Cards', ascending = False)[:10]
plt.figure(figsize = (20, 6))
plt.title("Players with the most yellow cards")
c = sns.barplot(x = epl_yellow['Name'], y = epl_yellow['Yellow_Cards'], label = 'Players', color ='yellow')
plt.ylabel('Number of Yellow Cards')
c.set_xticklabels(c.get_xticklabels(), rotation = 45)
plt.show()
```

## Data Visualization

Finally, we will visualize the data to make it more accessible and understandable. This includes creating plots, charts, and graphs.
